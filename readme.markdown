# kreeger's dotfiles

Amazingly awesome, bizarrely compelling, downright sweet-ass `dotfiles`. Any questions?

## Installation

To install, run `rake` inside the `dotfiles` directory. This will do just about everything. To run a specific setup, run `rake -T` to see what's available. There's a lot in here that I use personally that you may find useful; feel free to steal.
