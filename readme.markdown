# kreeger's dotfiles

Amazingly awesome, bizarrely compelling, downright sweet-ass `dotfiles`.
Any questions?

## I use these with...

 * [b4winckler/macvim](http://github.com/b4winckler/macvim)

And many more. On channel four.

## Vim plugins, too

And tons more. Check `vim.yml` for the skinny.

## Installation

To install, run `rake` inside the `dotfiles` directory. This will do just about
everything. To run a specific setup, run `rake -T` to see what's available.
There's a lot in here that I use personally that you may find useful; feel free
to steal.
